# Deco-Mongo

## Description

deco-mongo is a lightweight MongoDB ODM written in Typescript that takes advantage of newer Javascript features like reflection and decorators.  When using Typescript, I've found that Mongoose, while tried and true, is a bit clunky to work with.  At the same time, using the MongoDB driver directly requires some additional infrastructure to use in a well-factored, real world application, which might as well be generalized, so here we are. :-)

This project is still early in its development with the initial focus on developing a mapping layer that enables conversion between in-memory Typescript classes and MongoDB documents.  Changes are likely.  Documentation will added as things start to stabilize.
