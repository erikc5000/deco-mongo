# Deco-Mongo

## Description

deco-mongo is an extremely lightweight MongoDB ODM written in Typescript that takes advantage of newer Javascript features like reflection and decorators.  When using Typescript, I've found that Mongoose, while tried and true, is a bit clunky to work with.  At the same time, using the MongoDB driver directly requires some additional infrastructure to use in a well-factored, real world application, which might as well be generalized, so here we are. :-)
